1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
  SELECT * FROM top_movies;
  1|fight club|1999|true|1
  2|shawshank redemption|1994|true|1
  3|the godfather|1972|false|1
  4|the dark knight|2008|false|2
  5|spirited away|2001|false|3
  6|grave of the fireflies|1998|true|4
  7|up|2009|true|5
  8|eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|2004|true|6

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
  UPDATE top_movies SET mike_fav="true" WHERE title="spirited away";
  SELECT * FROM top_movies WHERE title="spirited away";
  5|spirited away|2001|true|3

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
  SELECT * FROM top_movies, genres WHERE top_movies.genre_id = genres.id;
  1|fight club|1999|true|1|1|drama
  2|shawshank redemption|1994|true|1|1|drama
  3|the godfather|1972|false|1|1|drama
  4|the dark knight|2008|false|2|2|crime
  5|spirited away|2001|true|3|3|anime fantasy
  6|grave of the fireflies|1998|true|4|4|anime drama
  7|up|2009|true|5|5|3d animation - fantasy/comedy/drama
  8|eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|2004|true|6|6|romance/sci-fi

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
  SELECT top_movies.title, genres.genre FROM top_movies JOIN genres ON top_movies.genre_id = genres.id;
  fight club|drama
  shawshank redemption|drama
  the godfather|drama
  the dark knight|crime
  spirited away|anime fantasy
  grave of the fireflies|anime drama
  up|3d animation - fantasy/comedy/drama
  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|romance/sci-fi

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
  DELETE FROM top_movies WHERE title="the godfather";
  SELECT * FROM top_movies;
  1|fight club|1999|true|1
  2|shawshank redemption|1994|true|1
  4|the dark knight|2008|false|2
  5|spirited away|2001|true|3
  6|grave of the fireflies|1998|true|4
  7|up|2009|true|5
  8|eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|2004|true|6

1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?

inner join - Select all records from Table A and Table B, where the join condition is met.

left join - Select all records from Table A, along with records from Table B for which the join condition is met (if at all).

right join - Select all records from Table B, along with records from Table A for which the join condition is met (if at all).

full join - Select all records from Table A and Table B, regardless of whether the join condition is met or not.

cross join - The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN. This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product. If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN.


2. Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

SELECT title, year, mike_fav FROM top_movies INNER JOIN genres ON top_movies.genre_id = genres.id;
fight club|1999|true
shawshank redemption|1994|true
the dark knight|2008|false
spirited away|2001|true
grave of the fireflies|1998|true
up|2009|true
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|2004|true
NOTE: All records have a corresponding genre id so they're all returned by the query.

SELECT title, year, mike_fav FROM top_movies LEFT JOIN genres ON top_movies.genre_id = genres.id;
fight club|1999|true
shawshank redemption|1994|true
the dark knight|2008|false
spirited away|2001|true
grave of the fireflies|1998|true
up|2009|true
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind|2004|true
NOTE: All records have a corresponding genre id so they're all returned by the query.
