You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
SELECT * FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|5|excellent jiggles!|4|6|4|jiggly room jello|6|ariana|grande
2|4|solid jello!|4|4|4|jiggly room jello|4|dizzy|galespie
3|5|easily my new favorite cafe|2|3|2|fixins & mixins cafe|3|mike|tark
4|4|a very hip hidden watering hole|1|2|1|back alley gem|2|jessica|alba
5|1|my pickle was rotten|5|1|5|pickle barn|1|jack|black

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.f_name, users.l_name, businesses.b_name, stars, comment FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
