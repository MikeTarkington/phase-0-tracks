**Plans for learning jQuery**
1. google it to find out generally what it is
2. look for official source docs
  - official docs provide a great tutorial intro that I used to follow along and make my own notes as a picked up knowledge of the tools
3. refer to my trusty w3 schools
4. locate cheat sheets
5. see if i can apply it to any of my junk learning projects


- Taking a break may be important, particularly if I get stuck
- I like to test things as I go if the and build on examples given from other sources
- I test my theories and understanding of concepts as I'm learning the new technology
- there are certain points where moving ahead with lingering uncertainty can be necessary but there's also points where it's necessary to ensure clarity as other concepts may be continually misunderstood or confusing if prior necessities have not be thoroughly examined.
- I don't go through everything I can find but rather I cherry pick things I want to experiment with and try to be confident that I've found resources I can interpret to answer any questions I might have
