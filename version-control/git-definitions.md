# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control helps us collaborate, or even just work independently, on our code while taking great measures to protect the main files. It gives us save points we can revert to if something goes wrong. It provides a system for managing various versions as they are developed and integrating them together safely such that they don't break the code. It empowers contributors to be creative and experiment with thier versions of the code before it is absorbed into the final product.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch gives users the ability to take the main code base and edit it without immediate consequence to the code base. If the modifications made in a branch are deemed valuable they can be merged back into the code base to improve it. Alternatvely, users might develop in a completely different direction from the code base and create something new or very different using the foundation.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the action of accepting an update to files or folders within a branch of a repo. The message is important because it's an opportunity to indicate the changes made in the commit. It helps identify points at which the project made certain changes and in essence creates a save point one could revert to.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when a file(s) being integrated with a current working branch changes something that Git cannot figure out how to merge on its own.  This may occur in varius situations like when to people edit the same file on the same line or delete files that were only modified by another person.  Git notifies us of conflicts and then we provide it instruction on how to resolve the issue.

Now that we know some fundamental things about Git... Lets Git to it!!!
